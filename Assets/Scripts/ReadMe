API for Mixing Ingredients and Creating Potions
This API provides functionality for mixing various ingredients to create potions with different effects.

How to Use

1. Initialization
To use the API, create an instance of the `PotionMixer` class. You can do this as follows:

PotionMixer potionMixer = new PotionMixer();

2. Prepare Ingredients
Create ingredients containing preliminary effects. For example:

IIngredient<IPreliminaryEffect> ingredient1 = new Ingredient1();
IIngredient<IPreliminaryEffect> ingredient2 = new Ingredient2();
List<IIngredient<IPreliminaryEffect>> ingredients = new List<IIngredient<IPreliminaryEffect>>
{
    ingredient1,
    ingredient2,
};

3. Create a Potion
Use the Mix() method to mix the ingredients and create a potion:

var potion = potionMixer.Mix(ingredients);

Extending Functionality
The API allows extending functionality by adding new effects, effect groups, and rules for their combination.

1. Adding New Effects
To add new effects, create classes that implement the IPreliminaryEffect interface, depending on the type of effect.

2. Adding New Effect Groups
To add new effect groups, create an enum PreliminaryEffectGroup and use them to classify effects.

3. Adding New Combination Rules
Extending the functionality of combining effects is achieved by creating classes that implement the IRule interface. These classes can define specific rules for combining effect groups.
